## Workflow: upgrade mise packages

1. Run make mise-list in your $HOME directory to see what packages need to be upgraded
2. Run the recommended mise commands at the end of the output (like mise use package@version)
3. If mise configuration files changed, use git to add and commit the changed config files with conventional commits format

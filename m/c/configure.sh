# configure.sh - Configure accumulated data for optimal unification
# Part of ACUTE: Accumulate, Configure, Unify, Transform, Execute
#
# This script handles the Configure phase by processing accumulated raw data
# and preparing it in a format that is optimal for CUE unification. It applies
# transformations, normalizations, and enrichments to the raw data before
# unification with schemas.
#
# Prerequisites: Run accumulate.sh first to gather raw data

	# - Apply transformations
	# - Enrich data with computed fields
	# - Prepare data for schema validation

# Build Output Utilities

This directory contains Bazel build rules and utilities for handling build outputs. These tools manage how build artifacts are processed, packaged, and distributed.

## Files

- `BUILD.bazel` - Bazel build configuration for output utilities
- `out.bzl` - Bazel Starlark implementation of output handling rules and macros

The output utilities provide standardized mechanisms for collecting, transforming, and organizing build artifacts from the Bazel build system.

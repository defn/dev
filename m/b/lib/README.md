# Build Library Utilities

This directory contains shared library utilities and helper functions used across the build system. These utilities provide common functionality for build rules and scripts.

## Files

- `BUILD.bazel` - Bazel build configuration for build library utilities
- `lib.sh` - Shell library with common functions and utilities for build scripts

The build library utilities serve as a foundation for other build components, providing reusable functions and standardized patterns.

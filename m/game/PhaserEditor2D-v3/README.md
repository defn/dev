This is a full re-write of the editor, using web technologies.

Previous versions of the editor are based on the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org). Both are hosted [here](https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/PhaserEditor).

*We are an independent developer. Phaser Editor is not part of the Phaser project. Contact them at [phaser.io](https://phaser.io)*

### Main features

* The IDE runs in the browser. It has a small backend that can be run in the cloud or locally.

* It is lightweight and is focused on visual tools.

* However, it provides basic editors for coding JavaScript/TypeScript.

* Friendly for collaborators: it is coded in TypeScript and provides an extensible framework. The server side is coded in [Go](https://golang.org).

* It follows the Phaser standards and API. Extra plugins or runtimes are not required.
